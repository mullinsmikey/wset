# Contributing to Blue Muffin projects

Looking to contribute something to WSet? **Here's how you can help**

## Quick start

* [Submit a bug report](https://github.com/mullinsmikey/wset/issues/new?template=bug-report.md)

## Key branches

- `master` is the latest, deployed version

## Pull requests

- Pull requests that do not solve an existing issue are essentially un-prioritized–don't expect these to be addressed quickly
- The files in this repository are generated elsewhere and we do not merge PR's directly into master
- Try not to pollute your pull request with unintended changes–keep them simple and small
