* Any release may update the design, look-and-feel or functionality
* We will never release a `patch` version update that breaks compatibility
* A `minor` release **may include incompatible changes** but upgrading instructions will always be provided
* Bug fixes will be addressed as `patch` releases unless they include compatibility breaks then they will be `minor` releases
